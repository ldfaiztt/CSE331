# Find a path with only one "hop" (edge) using the full Marvel dataset.
# This test exercises both the parser and BFS algorithm on a rather large
# graph, so it is more of a system test than a true unit test. Such tests
# should only be run after you have tested the parser and BFS algorithm
# separately on much smaller graphs.

# To run this test, you will need to have downloaded the marvel dataset and
# place it in src/hw5/data/marvel.tsv.
